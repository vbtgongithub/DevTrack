# DevTrack Project Status

**Last updated:** June 18, 2026  
**Release track:** Beta Candidate  
**Overall health:** ~85% functional

---

## Build Status

| Component | Status | Verification |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Backend API | Green | `tsc -p tsconfig.json` compiles cleanly |
| Frontend client | Green | `tsc -b && vite build` succeeds |
| Database schemas | Green | 60+ Mongoose models with indexes |
| CI pipeline | Green | PR checks: typecheck, lint, unit, integration, Docker build |
| E2E suite | Partial | 4 Playwright flows; requires AI keys + running stack |

## Feature Completeness

### Fully implemented

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Auth (Clerk) | Done | Sign-in, user sync, SSE handshake |
| Dashboard | Done | Stats, missions, GitHub, activity, achievements |
| DSA workspace | Done | Problems, heatmap, submissions, contests, topics |
| Platform sync | Done | Codeforces (full), GitHub (full), LeetCode (partial), CodeChef (stats) |
| Projects | Done | CRUD, tasks, GitHub sync |
| Focus mode | Done | Missions, Pomodoro, persistent Zustand state |
| Resume intelligence | Done | Upload, parse, ATS, semantic, embeddings, credibility, export |
| Readiness OS | Done | Snapshot, roadmap, evolution, DSA intelligence, AI copilot |
| Gamification | Done | XP, streaks, missions, daily challenges |
| Notifications | Done | In-app + SSE delivery |
| Real-time (SSE) | Done | Singleton client, Redis pub/sub |
| Admin / ops | Done | Queues, DLQ replay, trust scores, beta dashboard |
| Onboarding | Done | Step tracking and analytics |

### Partial / degraded

| Area | Gap |
|------|-----|
| LeetCode sync | Public API limits — not full history |
| CodeChef | Stats only, no submission history |
| ATS integrations | Simulators only (Greenhouse, Workday, Lever, Taleo) — no live OAuth |
| AI features | Degrade when `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` unset |
| ML training pipelines | Infrastructure present; datasets not loaded in production |

## Backend Module Health

**23 route modules** mounted and connected. Key domains:

```
auth, dashboard, dsa, activity, projects, profile, settings,
platform-sync, xp, streak, ops, runtime-state, observation,
missions, notifications, onboarding, daily-challenge, coaching,
readiness, resume (upload), resume-intelligence, recommendations, analytics
```

### Workers

| Worker | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Platform sync | Operational |
| XP processing | Operational |
| System maintenance | Operational |
| Resume upload / ATS / semantic / embedding / recommendation | Operational |
| Resume intelligence (unified) | Operational |
| Dataset ingestion | Operational (ops-triggered) |

### Test coverage

| Suite | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| Unit (`vitest.config.ts`) | Resume parsing, ATS, queue resilience, beta validation |
| Integration (`vitest.integration.config.ts`) | Orchestrator, SSE handshake |
| Chaos (`backend/tests/chaos/`) | SSE reconnect storm, refresh storm, DLQ replay |
| E2E (`frontend/e2e/`) | Resume ATS, semantic recommendations, replay persistence, failure scenarios |

Estimated backend test coverage: ~65%. Gaps in ML module, platform sync adapters, and ops module tests.

## Frontend Health

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Pages & routing | 15+ routes with lazy loading and error boundaries |
| Feature modules | 15 domain modules under `src/features/` |
| API services | 16 Axios service modules |
| Zustand stores | 14 stores |
| Design system | Tailwind 4, motion system, skeleton loaders |
| Accessibility | ARIA attributes on interactive components |

### Minor UI inconsistency

Resume entry workspace uses a dark theme (`slate-950`) while the main app uses the light `dt-*` design tokens. Cosmetic only.

---

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Medium priority

1. **Root `.env.example` stale JWT vars** — References `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` / `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`; auth is Clerk-based. Use `backend/.env.example` instead.
2. **Docker frontend build arg** — Dockerfile may use `VITE_API_URL`; app reads `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
3. **Production port mismatch** — `docker-compose.prod.yml` defaults to 4000; dev uses 3001.
4. **DSA-resume credibility gap** — Some resume credibility paths may return simulated DSA data instead of live submission cross-checks.

### Low priority

1. **Orphaned internal modules** — `operations/`, `validation/`, `calibration/` have classes not fully exported through route modules.
2. **Dataset registry** — References `placement-intelligence-data/` paths; datasets not wired into runtime training.
3. **Worker restart** — No automatic recovery if a worker process crashes outside Docker orchestration.

## Active Validation

- End-to-end workflow across multi-tab SSE streams
- Timeline progression and milestone incrementation
- Growth loop telemetry (gap-alignment recalculation)
- Resume intelligence pipeline under load (queue drain, DLQ behavior)

---

## Roadmap (next sprints)

| Priority | Item |
|----------|------|
| High | Align root `.env.example` with Clerk auth |
| High | Wire DSA submission data into resume credibility scoring |
| Medium | Add platform sync adapter unit tests |
| Medium | Unify resume entry workspace theme |
| Low | Load ML training datasets from registry |
| Low | Real ATS OAuth integrations |

## Assessment

DevTrack is a feature-rich beta platform with a sound architectural foundation: decoupled workers, Clerk auth, versioned API, SSE real-time layer, and comprehensive domain modules. The frontend is production-ready. Remaining work centers on integration hardening (DSA-resume cross-validation, env template cleanup), test coverage expansion, and optional ML dataset activation.
